title: Working with top level elements
---

### Basics

You can optionally add top-level elements to the user story map. These can be toggled on and off like the previously available "Goal" feature, which this new functionality replaces.
Previously added goals stay in place, and can you can edit and use them just like before.

### Activating the top-level row

In the top right-hand corner, you will find the hierarchy button. Clicking it will open the drawer to configure the top-level row and change the second-level hierarchy issue and link types.

Select an issue type for the top-level row - the link type is required for dynamic maps and optional for static maps.
The app does not load elements already associated with this issue link type on a static map. 

On a dynamic map, changing the link type will reload the map that is currently displayed with the new configuration.

### Using the new top-level elements

After configuring the top-level row as described above, you can add issues via the add button in the top right-hand corner of the story map.

Create the issue by typing in the issue summary and hitting enter. You can now drag this issue to the top left-hand corner, where the new top-level element will appear.

After creation, you can drag elements from the backbone row to under the new top-level issue. The app will do the rest: associate the column with the top-level element and maintain the issue link between them.
