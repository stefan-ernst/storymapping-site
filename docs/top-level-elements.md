title: Working with top level elements

### Basics

You can optionally add top-level elements to the user story map. These can be toggled on and off like the previously available "Goal" feature, which this new functionality replaces.
Previously added goals stay in place, and can you can edit and use them just like before.

### Activating the top-level row

Select "Settings" via the application menu in the top left-hand corner. 
A toggle switch is visible on the tab "Map Configuration" to activate the top-level row.
Next to it is a visual representation of how the top-level elements will be positioned in the story map.

Please select an issue type to be used for the top-level row. You can do this later; however, adding elements will not be possible until the issue type is set.
Optionally, you can set a link type to connect the top-level elements to the lower-level elements. Please note that the story mapping app does not load elements already associated with this issue link type. We are planning to add this functionality in a future release.

### Using the new top-level elements
After configuring the top-level row as described above, you can add and activity via the create button in the top right-hand corner of the story map.

After creation, you can drag elements from the backbone row to under the new top-level element. The story mapping app will do the rest: associate the column with the top-level element and maintain the issue link between them.
