After installation, Story Mapping app will be available in 
all Software projects (Business projects are not supported at this time).

When you first open the story map, you can start adding
Epics and assigning tickets right away. 
But it's best to set up the backlog from the start 
by selecting a board in top right-hand corner.

<img src={SelectBoard} style={{width:'20rem'}} />

By selecting a board that includes more than one project in the board
filter, you can use issues from multiple projects in your story map.

<img src={SelectBoard2} style={{width:'20rem',marginBottom:'2rem'}} />

Keep in mind however that release information works on a per-project
basis, so release mapping will not work when more than one project is used
in the filter.

Once the board is set up, you are good to go.
