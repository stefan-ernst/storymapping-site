The following section explains the many possible settings for your user story map

### Backlog Configuration

You can select a new Jira agile board here at any time. The agile board will be used to 
gather sprint and release information as well as to gather unassigned issues to form the
backlog of the story map.

Additionally, the sorting and filter of the backlog can be controlled here. 

### Field Configuration

#### Epic Fields

You can display statistics for the Epic here, for example, the number of issues in the Epic, which
state these issues have, the percentage of story points done or simply the percentage of issues done in total.

#### Swimlanes

Configure whether to either display the number of story points in each status or the number of issues in each status.

#### Issue Fields

You can select from a variety of fields to display in the story map. Story Mapping app
supports all text and number fields, as well a selection of multi- and single-select fields.

You can also display many Jira standard fields like Labels, Assignee, Reporter, etc.

### Display Options

#### Column coloring

Use the color selected for the epic to color the entire column. This helps separate columns visually.

#### Show goal swimlane

#### Hide Epic Issue Key

Hide the epic issue key in the story map. This can help with readability.

#### Show tool icons

Display all icons by default.
