### The overview screen

You can manage multiple maps inside a single project. You will be presented with the overview screen when opening the app for the first time or if the project does not contain any story maps.
You will find a list of all available story maps here, and you will be able to create a new one.
For each story map, you will have the following options:

#### View

Jump right into your story map.

#### Open by default

You can skip the overview screen in the future if you want to primarily work with one story map. When clicking the star icon, the app will save this configuration for you, the individual user, not the entire project. Next time, your primary story map will load when opening the app.

#### Rename

Rename the story map anytime to keep organized.

#### Remove

Will remove the story map alongside all the configurations. The issues inside the story map will not be affected.

### Adding a new story map 

Please read our guide [here](./pro-setup).
