### Basics

After adding the story map, you can add an existing epic via search function 
or create a new epic.

You can assign issues to the epic the same way, either search for them or create new ones.

### Working with multiple epics

You can add additional epics to the story map at any point. The epics can be marked
with custom colors. These colors do not correspond to the epic colors of Jira (the selection
 is too limited), so you can select any color you want here.

Once you have the second column set up, you can start moving issues between epics. Simply drag
and drop them onto the second column.

### Inline Editing

You can adjust the issue summary or the epic title at any time by clicking the edit icon
or by double clicking on the card.
