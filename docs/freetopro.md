title: Upgrading from the free to the pro edition
---

### No Action required when upgrading

Upgrading from the free edition is very easy. Advanced Story Maps for Jira works with 
the data structures from the free edition and adds additional data when needed.

Simply install the app and make sure to uninstall the free edition, as 
there will be two menu entries otherwise.
