Atlassian Jira has been used by software teams around the world for decades - and with
growing demand for digital task management solutions that integrate well, teams have found
that they can use Jira for even more disciplines in product or service delivery.
One of these is the portfolio management which can be done in
Jira in various ways. Did you know you can use a tool as simple as
a story mapping app to create a high level portfolio map across multiple projects?
Let's take a look.

<!--truncate-->

On a high level, portfolio management controls delivery over 
multiple teams, projects, initiatives or programs. In practice,
portfolio managers in Jira often deal with the limitations 
of Jira's default functionality. For example, you can't put issues in the hierarchy 
above the built-in Epic issue type.
One way to circumvent this, is by using issues links to connect issues
and then use either a third party tool like Jira Align or one of
the various Gantt-Chart or Roadmap-Apps from the Atlassian Marketplace
to build a high level overview over multiple Jira projects and Epics.

Another way to achieve this goal is to start simple - why not build a
simple visual map of your initiatives and link either Epics from projects or
other representations of high level planning items to these initiatives?
In this example, we do this by creating a new project and customizing its issue types.

If you have a team-managed project in Jira, you can do this
with project administrator permissions. If you have a company managed project,
or you lack the required administrative rights, you can ask your Jira
administrator to create issue types for you. In our example we will
use 3 issue types according to SAFe principles.

- Portfolio Epic
- Enabler
- Feature

You can name these any way you want or rename them later if needed.

<img src={PortfolioMap} style={{width:490,height:377}} alt="Portfolio Map Example" />

Here is what the portfolio map looks like for example.

Now how do we achieve this? With Story Mapping for Jira, you can select 
any issue type for the backbone row of your map (the top row). Go to the
app settings and choose the issue type from the dropdown menu.

<img src={EpicSelect} style={{width:245,height:232}} alt="Selecting a custom epic type from a dropdown" />

This issue type is then used in place of an Epic like you would use it in
a classic story map in Jira.

You can optionally select a custom link type to connect the two sub-issue-types
to the Portfolio Epic type. **This is important if you later want to use
the tree structure that we create here in a gantt chart or a roadmap**.

<img src={LinkSelect} style={{width:245,height:232}} alt="Selecting a link type from a dropdown" />

Now we have set up everything we need, we can start creating the portfolio map.
If you set up a Kanban board in the same project, you can basically
do the portfolio kanban method in parallel to the portfolio planning done in the 
story map. 

You would work the following way: You create or assign your features and enablers
in the story map, then later on you can move them in the kanban board, changing
their status, which in turn gets reflected back into the story map. You can
double check if items with priority are not moving or are in an unsuitable
status at any point.

In the next blog post we will talk about planning long term with
custom timeframes, and how to use the plan view of the story mapping app. Stay tuned!
